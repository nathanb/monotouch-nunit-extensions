monotouch-nunit-extensions
==========================

I've build up this quick set of extension methods to help make NUnit testing on MonoTouch simpler (with an element of BDD). There's plenty of room to expand these. I only implemented the few extensions I needed for the moment. Feel free to contribute enhancements if you find it useful. 

Derive from SpecBase for a simplified test fixture.
