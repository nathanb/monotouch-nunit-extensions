monotouch-nunit-extensions
==========================

Without custom generic methods available in MonoTouch, I've build up this quick set of extension methods to help make NUnit testing on MonoTouch simpler (with an element of BDD). There's plenty of room to expand these. I only implemented the few extensions I needed for the moment. Feel free to contribute enhancements if you find it useful. 

Derive from SpecBase for a simplified test fixture.
